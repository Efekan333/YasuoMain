# YasuoMain
My personal League stattracking Project, with a focus on my main league character Yasuo! 

My methodology and Plan; 
  1. Backend;
      - API acces (Riot)
      - KDA, CS(per min), (pathing), Kills with timestamps, Build (Runes, items etc), team gold, game impact,
      - the same with Proplayers
      - Putting it in relation with my stats
        
  2. Frontend;
      - Visualizing it with Graphs and other cool math
      - Making it cool and all
      - Markdown or HTML for Webpage (?)
